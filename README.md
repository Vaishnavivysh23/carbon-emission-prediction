# carbon-emission-prediction
Carbon emission prediction refers to the process of using data and computational models to forecast the amount of carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) that will be emitted into the atmosphere over a specific period. This is crucial for monitoring climate change and planning mitigation strategies.

# Key Objectives:

Forecast future emissions based on current trends in energy consumption, transportation, industry, etc.
Identify major contributors to emissions (e.g., power plants, vehicles, manufacturing).
Support policy-making and climate action plans.
Track progress toward emission reduction targets.

# Applications in Society:

Helps governments and industries make informed environmental decisions.
Assists in climate risk assessment.
Drives green technology adoption.
Enables public awareness and accountability.
